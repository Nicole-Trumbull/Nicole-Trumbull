### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Nicole Trumbull, and I am a 43 year old mother of 4, wife, and once more, a student.
 
 ðŸŒ±   I'm currently enrolled with Coding Dojo in their Python stack boot camp. I used to be a computer science student until my now husband and I learned that we were expecting our daughter, and we agreed that child care was too expensive. I decided that once my children were all grown up, then I would look at going back to school.

 ðŸ˜© I struggle with JavaScript when working on web pages. I think that it's because I get wrapped up in the design of the web page, that when I transition over to JavaScript for the page, it's like I'm stumbling over a curb.

 ðŸ’¬ People ask me about my hobbies. Well, I'm a gamer Mom and an amateur shutterbug. I've been playing World of Warcraft since before it's first expansion, The Burning Crusade, was released. One day I'll make a point to share some of the photography I've done! 

 ðŸ“« It's usually best to try and reach me through [email](nicole.trumbull80@gmail.com) - at least for now.

ðŸ’¥ Fun fact - I'm a Leo and an avid cat mom. We have several cats in our home, but my 2 babies include a flame lynx point Siamese named Sugar, and a silver tabby kitten named Alexander. All but 1 of our kitties are feral rescues that we've won over.
